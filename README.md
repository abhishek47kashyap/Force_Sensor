# Force_Sensor

This work is on designing a distributed sensor to determine direction of force applied by the Master Tool Manipulator
(MTM) of the da-Vinci surgical robot on the userâ€™s hands (more specifically, fingers). The sensing modality is optical, and the sensor assembly is to be mounted on the _wrist roll_ link of the MTM.
